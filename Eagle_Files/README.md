#Eagle Files
All files were designed with CadSoft Eagle PCB Design v7.5 (Eagle).  These files are provided AS IS and are not to be used for commercial purpose.
CadSoft provides several licensing options for Eagle, including a [Freeware license](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/download-eagle/freeware/) and a
[commercial light](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/eagle-pricing/) license.  Additional information
can be found on the [CadSoft website](http://www.cadsoftusa.com)

#BRD and SCH
The BRD (Board) files are the physical board layout files and the SCH (Schematic) files are the schematic for the circuit.

#GERBERS
I will upload the latest GERBER files as soon as possible.  GERBER files are industry standard and can be sent to almost any PCB manufacturer.
They do not require the use of CadSoft Eagle to view and use.
